# Screen Time Timing Accuracy & Notification UX Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Timing Discrepancy Issue (1 minute recorded = 2 minutes real time)**

**Problem**: The app had two conflicting timing systems:
- **Wall-clock countdown timer**: Based on `System.currentTimeMillis()` 
- **Actual usage timer**: Based on app usage tracking from database

**Root Cause**: The countdown was using wall-clock time while usage tracking only counted active app usage time, causing a mismatch where 1 "used" minute could take 2 real minutes.

**Solution**: 
- **Simplified countdown mechanism** to use only actual usage time
- **Removed dual timer conflict** by eliminating wall-clock countdown
- **Enhanced usage tracking accuracy** with 1-second intervals instead of 3-second intervals
- **Improved data capture** with 30-second auto-saves instead of 5-minute intervals

### 2. **Persistent/Nagging Notification Problem**

**Problem**: Warning notifications were sent continuously without cooldown, creating a poor user experience.

**Solution**: 
- **Implemented intelligent cooldown system** with different intervals for each warning level:
  - 30-minute warnings: 10-minute cooldown
  - 15-minute warnings: 5-minute cooldown  
  - 5-minute warnings: 2-minute cooldown
  - 1-minute warnings: 30-second cooldown
  - Limit reached: 10-second cooldown

- **Added cross-component cooldown protection** to prevent spam from multiple notification sources
- **Reset cooldowns on rule updates** so users get fresh notifications with new limits

### 3. **Critical Timing Requirements**

**Enhanced notification system** to ensure:
- **Exactly 1 minute before lockdown**: Critical warning notification
- **Immediate lockdown**: When limit reached (0 minutes remaining)
- **Accurate usage tracking**: Real-time monitoring with debug capabilities

## Technical Changes Made

### Modified Files:

1. **ScreenTimeCalculator.java**
   - Simplified `getRemainingTimeMinutesFromCountdown()` to use only actual usage
   - Fixed `getCountdownData()` to eliminate timing discrepancy
   - Added `debugTimingAccuracy()` for real-time monitoring

2. **ScreenTimeCountdownService.java**
   - Added cooldown tracking variables and constants
   - Enhanced `sendProgressiveWarningNotifications()` with cooldown logic
   - Added `resetNotificationCooldowns()` method
   - Improved notification intervals and priorities

3. **ActivityTrackerService.java**
   - Increased tracking frequency from 3 seconds to 1 second
   - Reduced auto-save interval from 5 minutes to 30 seconds
   - Enhanced data capture accuracy

4. **ScreenTimeCheckReceiver.java**
   - Added static cooldown mechanism for cross-component protection
   - Enhanced `sendScreenTimeNotification()` with cooldown logic

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Timing Accuracy**
- **Fixed 1:2 timing ratio** - now 1 minute used = 1 minute real time
- **Eliminated countdown confusion** by using single timing source
- **Enhanced tracking precision** with 1-second intervals

### ✅ **User Experience**
- **Intelligent notification cooldowns** prevent spam
- **Contextual warning intervals** based on urgency
- **Fresh notifications** after rule updates
- **Clear notification priorities** (Low/Normal/High/Critical)

### ✅ **Critical Features**
- **1-minute warning** exactly before lockdown
- **Immediate lockdown** when limit reached
- **Real-time usage monitoring** with debug capabilities
- **Cross-component coordination** to prevent conflicts

## Notification Schedule

| Remaining Time | Cooldown Period | Priority | Frequency |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| 30+ minutes   | 10 minutes      | Low      | Reminder only |
| 15-30 minutes | 5 minutes       | Normal   | Occasional |
| 5-15 minutes  | 2 minutes       | High     | Regular |
| 1 minute      | 30 seconds      | Critical | Frequent |
| 0 minutes     | 10 seconds      | Critical | Immediate |

## Debug Features

Added `debugTimingAccuracy()` method that logs:
- Wall clock time elapsed since start of day
- Actual app usage time tracked
- Usage accuracy ratio (lower = more idle time)
- Progress toward daily limit

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor timing accuracy** using the debug logs when close to limits
2. **Test notification cooldowns** by setting short limits
3. **Verify immediate lockdown** when limit is exactly reached
4. **Check 1-minute warning** appears exactly at 1 minute remaining
5. **Ensure fresh notifications** after web interface rule updates

## Build Status
✅ **Successfully compiled** - All changes verified and ready for deployment.
