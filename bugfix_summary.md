# Build Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AndroidManifest.xml Issues
- Removed the duplicate `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` permission declaration
- Removed the deprecated `package` attribute from the manifest tag as recommended by the Android Gradle Plugin

### 2. Missing Imports in BlockingCoordinator.java
- Added missing `android.content.Intent` import
- Fixed references to `Intent` class that were causing "cannot find symbol" errors

### 3. Missing Imports in BlockingTesterActivity.java
- Added the following missing imports:
  - `android.app.ActivityManager`
  - `android.content.ContentValues`
  - `android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase`
  - `android.content.Context`
- Fixed the `ACTIVITY_SERVICE` constant reference by using the fully qualified name `Context.ACTIVITY_SERVICE`

## Technical Details

### Import Issues
The primary issue was missing imports for classes that were being used in the code. When Java can't find a class reference, it reports a "cannot find symbol" error. This was happening with:
- `Intent` in BlockingCoordinator.java
- `SQLiteDatabase`, `ContentValues`, and `ActivityManager` in BlockingTesterActivity.java

### AndroidManifest.xml Issues
- Duplicate permissions cause warnings during the build process
- The `package` attribute in the manifest is deprecated in favor of the `namespace` property in the build.gradle.kts file

## Future Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Always ensure proper imports are present when using classes from other packages
2. Use an IDE with auto-import capabilities
3. Regularly clean and rebuild the project to catch errors early
4. Check manifest files for duplicate declarations

## Build Status
After applying these fixes, the app builds successfully without compiler errors.
